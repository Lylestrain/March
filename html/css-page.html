      <p>I came across a you tube video I thought I would try.I thought it is a nice looking way to display some css features.I've incorporated the colour scheme from the background and header and main content area.The varied border radius is a nice touch,I also added some box shadow, background_linear_gradient,I also used google fonts font-family: 'Fjalla One', I noticed in the code there was also: 'Bree Serif' and 'Lobster' fonts used.<br>I used a button tag  for the home link button.In the you tube video the buttons on hover, are used to change an image.<br>As a first project the benefits of producing a mock-up of the project to clarify visually what and where elements wil go.<br>Here's the youtube video<a class="my_button" id="btn_2" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuHN3iPy-U">VIDEO</a><br>and the list of "tricks". 1. Gradients
        2. Google Fonts
        3. Vertical Alignment
        4. Transitions
        5. Changing Behaviour of Sibling Elements </p>
